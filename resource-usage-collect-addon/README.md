# Prototype of extensible scheduling using resources usage.
We already support [extensible placement scheduling](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/enhancements/blob/main/enhancements/sig-architecture/32-extensiblescheduling/32-extensiblescheduling.md), which allows use of [addonplacementscore](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/enhancements/blob/main/enhancements/sig-architecture/32-extensiblescheduling/32-extensiblescheduling.md#addonplacementscore-api) to select clusters, but we lack an addonplacementscore that contains cluster resource usage information.

In this repo, I developed an addon through addon-freamwork, this addon is mainly used to collect resource usage information on the cluster, and generate an addonplacementscore under the cluster namespace of the hub.


# Quickstart
## Prepare
You have at least two running kubernetes cluster. One is the hub cluster, the other is managedcluster.

You can create an ocm environment by running below command, which will create a hub and two managedclusters for you.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-cluster-management-io/OCM/main/solutions/setup-dev-environment/local-up.sh | bash
```

## Deploy

Set environment variables.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=</path/to/hub_cluster/kubeconfig> # export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```

Build the docker image to run the sample AddOn.

```bash
# get imagebuilder first
go get github.com/openshift/imagebuilder/cmd/imagebuilder@v1.2.1
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
# build image
make images
```

If your are using kind,Â load image into kind cluster.

```bash
export EXAMPLE_IMAGE_NAME=quay.io/haoqing/resource-usage-collect-addon:latest
kind load docker-image $EXAMPLE_IMAGE_NAME --name cluster_name # kind load docker-image  $EXAMPLE_IMAGE_NAME --name hub
```

And then deploy the example AddOns controller on hub cluster.

```bash
make deploy
```

## What is next

After the deployment is complete, addon will create an addonplacementscore in its own namespace for each managedcluster in the hub.

```bash
kubectl config use kind-hub
kubectl get addonplacementscore -A
```

After the addonplacementscore is successfully generated, you can use [extensible placement scheduling](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/enhancements/blob/main/enhancements/sig-architecture/32-extensiblescheduling/32-extensiblescheduling.md) to select clusters.

### For example

Select a cluster with more memory free.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 1
  prioritizerPolicy:
    mode: Exact
    configurations:
      - scoreCoordinate:
          type: AddOn
          addOn:
            resourceName: test-score1
            scoreName: memAvailable
        weight: 1
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl get placementdecisions -A
```

# Clean up

```bash
# clean up this addon
make undeploy
```
